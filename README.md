# CarNexus Virtual Showroom

This project is a web-based showroom application for buying, exploring, and servicing cars. Designed for a fictional dealership called *CarNexus*, the platform provides both customer-facing pages and an admin backend to manage services and test drives.

## 🚗 Features

- **Car Comparison** (`5Compare.html`) to compare multiple models.
- **Offers Page** (`6Offers.html`) listing current promotions.
- **EMI Calculator** (`7EMI.html`) to estimate monthly payments.
- **Customer Reviews** (`8Review.html`) section.
- **Location Information** (`9Location.html`) to find showrooms.
- **Authentication** pages: `Login.html`, `Signup.html`, `forgetpassword.html`.
- **Admin Panel** (`AdminPanel.html`) and associated backend PHP scripts for login, logout, dashboard, and CRUD operations on services and test drives.
- **Data Storage**: PHP and text files (`SignupData.txt`, `TestdriveData.txt`) for user and test drive information.
- **Frontend assets**: HTML, CSS (`style.css`, `cars.css`), JavaScript (`web.js`), images in `/photo` and videos.
